## System Architecture

### Web Framework & Backend
- **PHP** for server-side logic.
- **PDO** for database interaction with prepared statements.
- **PHP Session** for native session management with security hardening.
- **BCrypt** for password hashing (cost 12).
- **Design Rationale:** Native PHP is chosen for ease of deployment on shared hosting and minimal dependencies.

### Database Schema
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary database.
- **Core Tables:** `users` (multi-role), `exams` (metadata, premium status), `questions` (multiple-choice, essay), `exam_attempts` (submissions, cheating warnings), `payments` (processing, admin approval), `leaderboards` (branch-specific and global), `payment_settings` (QRIS, instructions).
- **Design Rationale:** PostgreSQL for production readiness, concurrent access, and foreign key constraints.

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with Admin, Teacher, and Student roles.
- **PHP Native Session Management:** Includes session regeneration, token validation, IP address validation, and secure cookie settings.
- **CSRF Protection:** CSRF tokens on all POST forms.
- **Password Security:** BCrypt hashing using `password_hash()` and `password_verify()`.
- **Design Rationale:** Comprehensive native PHP security features protect against common web vulnerabilities.

### Branch Competition System
- Supports **4 distinct branches** (Inspiranet_Cakrawala 1-4).
- **Dual Leaderboards:** Branch-specific for local competition and global for overall ranking.
- **Design Rationale:** Fosters motivation through fair competition within smaller groups and visible overall achievement.

### Anti-Cheating Architecture
- **Client-Side Protections:** Auto-logout on copy attempt, auto-restart exam on tab/window switching (clears answers), security warning modal, screenshot blocking, right-click prevention.
- **Real-time Timer Enforcement:** Strict time limits.
- **Tracking:** Cheating warnings logged per exam attempt.
- **Design Rationale:** Multi-layered client-side enforcement creates strong barriers against common cheating methods.

### Payment & Premium Content
- Supports **Free and Premium exams**.
- **Dual Payment Workflows:** Student-initiated (upload proof, admin approval) and Admin-initiated (direct approval).
- **Configurable Payment Settings:** Admin can upload QRIS images and set bank details.
- **File Upload Handling:** Secure filename processing for payment proofs.
- **Design Rationale:** Flexible system accommodates various payment scenarios and customizable payment information.

### Frontend Architecture
- **PHP Templates:** Server-side rendering with an include system.
- **Custom CSS:** With CSS variables for theming and responsive design (light blue theme).
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** For interactivity, anti-cheat enforcement, and async operations.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- **Enhanced UI Elements:** Profile photo in navbar, countdown timer (HH:MM:SS), visual question status (grey=unanswered, green=answered, yellow=doubtful), leaderboard with trophy icons, combined highest scores.
- **Typography & Accessibility:** Dark text (#1a1a1a, #2d2d2d) on light backgrounds for maximum readability, white text on dark components (navbar, stat-cards, modals). Bold font weights (600-800) for headings and important text. All times displayed in WIB (Asia/Jakarta) timezone.
- **Design Rationale:** PHP includes for modularity, vanilla JS for performance, and responsive design for broad device compatibility. A consistent light blue theme with high-contrast text ensures excellent readability across all devices.

### File Structure
- `config/`: Application configuration (database, auth, helpers, main config, schema).
- `app/Views/includes/`: Reusable template components (header, navbar, footer).
- `public/`: Document root with entry points for various user roles (`admin/`, `teacher/`, `student/`), authentication pages, API endpoints, and static assets.
- `storage/uploads/`: For file uploads (profiles, payments, answers, QRIS).
